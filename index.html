      <h1>Regime Type and War</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Our project aims to describe the impact and interplay of regime-type (e.g. democracy, autocracy) on a variety of unit-level variables. Additionally, we look at the cross sections between many of these other variables to identify correlations in the data that may be independent of our variable of interest. We use three datasets, both independently, and merged together. The Correlates of War (COW) dataset provides information about war initiation, war duration, casualties, and war outcomes. The National Military Capabilities (NMC) dataset provides year-by-year data for each country regarding the size and composition of a given state's military. The Polity dataset provides scores for how democratic a country is in a given year. By merging these three datasets together, we were able to compare material capabilities with democracy values and war outcomes. The visualizations we generated revealed four major insights. First, countries have become more democratic over time. Second, while the size of a country is correlated with military expenditure, the number of military personnel is not. Third, military personnel counts jump more rapidly during times of war as compared with military expenditures. Fourth, the size of a country's urban population (which is itself a proxy for development), is modestly correlated with democratization. 

            By identifying trends in the data, we hope to provide clarity so as to better predict war-related outcomes.  </p>

            <h2 class = text-center>Data Journey</h2><p class = text-center>Because we accessed, stored, converted, and cleaned three datasets, this section of the project took considerable time and resources, but nevertheless resulted in a fruitful array of insights in regards to our research questions. The data itself was stored in csv files, and the datasets were compiled by the Correlates of War and Polity projects. These non-profit academic organizations are themselves operated by the University of Texas and the Center for Systemic Peace respectively. We picked these datasets because it had a large spread of data on variables of that were statistically interesting. We chose datasets that had overlapping variables so that we could merge the files (country names, country codes, and years). Problematically, the Polity and COW datasets do not have data for every year, and as a result, there were large gaps in the data between the datasets. This required cleaning, so as to seamlessly merge the two datasets together. While ambitious, the learning process was very rewarding and ultimately successful.

        <h6> We developed our visualizations based on three primary datasets: the NMC dataset (National Military Capabilities Project), the COW dataset (Correlates of War), and the Polity Dataset. The NMC dataset comprises information on states categorized by year, detailing military personnel, expenditures, total population, and urban population. With a vast collection of 16,000 entries, it stands as the largest dataset among the three. The COW dataset offers insights into various wars, providing details on their start and end dates, initiating parties, and casualty counts for each conflict. Lastly, the Polity Dataset measures a country's democratic status on a scale from -10 (indicating full autocracy) to 10 (representing democracy). Countries scoring 6 or higher are considered full democracies. Notably, all three datasets span from the 1800s to the present day, offering a comprehensive historical perspective for our visualizations.</h6>
